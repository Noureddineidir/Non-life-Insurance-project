# Non-life-Insurance-project
Auto Insurance Pricing

This repo covers a non-life insurance assignement for ENSAE courses. The instructions are given [here](https://github.com/Noureddineidir/Non-life-Insurance-project/blob/8018d867cb5fb83720031870876c719ee6952578/consignes/Instruction-Projet.pdf). Data comes from the Third Actuarial Pricing Game. For more information on the data available and the context of the competition, please refer to [this document](https://github.com/Noureddineidir/Non-life-Insurance-project/blob/8018d867cb5fb83720031870876c719ee6952578/consignes/3rdPricingGame.pdf).

The main goal of this project is to calibrate models based on the traditional frequency/severity approach with GLMs. We provide in fine two databases containing the pure premium pricing as well as a commercial pricing (with a surcharge rate).

The repo is organized in folders used at different stages of the project. A brief description of the folders is given below
